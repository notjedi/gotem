# gotem

A glamorous clone of [tremc](https://github.com/tremc/tremc).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Clean up code (management of height and width between `tea` models, keymaps, utils, etc)
- [ ] Read-only client (only able to inspect all running torrents and their info)
- [ ] Basic torrent manipulations (add new torrents, pause, rename, force-announce, start, verify,
   change priority for files, etc)
- [ ] More features: sort, change download/upload speeds(both global and local), filter
- [ ] Help menu, peer flag info
- [ ] Config file for default sort, filter, colors and other settings (maybe with profiles?)
